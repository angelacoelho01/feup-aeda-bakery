Bakery Store management application serving as AEDA 1st project.
A client should be able to enter the store app and select a new order, to be delivered at their preferred location, with their desired products (from the stock) and quantities. The application automatically assigns the less busy worker to make the delivery.
The boss is in charge of adding new store delivery locations, managing the stock and the staff.
